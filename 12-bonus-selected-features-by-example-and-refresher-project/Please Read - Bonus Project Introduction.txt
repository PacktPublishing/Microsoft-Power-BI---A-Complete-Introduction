Please Read: Bonus Project Introduction
The taxi project is a very condensed project containing many core concepts taught in the course.

You can use this project for both practicing your knowledge and also as a quick "refresher" in case you haven't used Power BI for a while. It's fully optional though as we covered all features applied (and a lot more) throughout the course already.
