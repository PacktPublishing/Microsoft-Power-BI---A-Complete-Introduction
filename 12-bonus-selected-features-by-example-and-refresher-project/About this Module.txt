About this Module
Bonus content

The following two lectures are standalone lectures and not related to the course project. Both lectures cover individual Power BI features and show example use cases of these.

---

For the "Group By, Big Data & DAX Studio" lecture no source file is provided as the file size (1.8 GB) simply is too big to attach it here. Please use this lecture as a reference for your own datasets, the idea is just to show you some slightly more advanced features and example usecases of these in Power BI.

Enjoy the optional lectures :)
